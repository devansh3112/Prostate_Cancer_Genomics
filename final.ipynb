    "### About Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description**:  \n",
    "This dataset is a carefully curated compilation of genomic data related to prostate cancer, created by merging four GEO Series (GSE) datasets from the NCBI database. The selection process involved identifying datasets associated with three specific GPL platforms (GPL570, GPL96, and GPL571) to ensure compatibility and consistency across the data. The final dataset provides a comprehensive resource for analyzing gene expression and genomic variations across different prostate cancer conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Sources**:  \n",
    "The primary source of this dataset is Kaggle, available at [Prostate Cancer Genomics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sabetm/prostate-cancer-genomics). Initially, several GSE datasets with different GPL platforms were downloaded from the NCBI database. After an in-depth analysis, it was determined that GPL570, GPL96, and GPL571 platforms share significant overlap. Therefore, datasets corresponding to these three platforms were selected for further analysis. The raw data for each GSE was downloaded from the NCBI GEO database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi). If a dataset lacked raw data, it was excluded from the selection. The four selected GSE datasets are:\n",
    "- GSE32448\n",
    "- GSE46602\n",
    "- GSE7307\n",
    "- GSE69223\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing**:  \n",
    "The selected datasets were categorized into three groups based on the \"Gillison\" classification:\n",
    "- Normal\n",
    "- Benign\n",
    "- Tumor  \n",
    "Subsequently, the quality of the data was assessed using the MetaQC package in R. The results confirmed that these four datasets were of the highest quality and suitable for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Column Descriptions**:  \n",
    "- **First Row (GSE Names)**: The first row contains the names of the GEO Series (GSE) datasets from which the data were sourced. Each column corresponds to a specific GSE, indicating the origin of the sample data.\n",
    "- **Second Row (GSM Identifiers)**: The second row includes the GEO Sample (GSM) identifiers, which are unique identifiers for each sample within the GSE datasets. These identifiers help trace back each sample to its original source in the NCBI GEO database.\n",
    "- **Gillison Classification (Parameter after _)**: The numbers following the underscore in the second row represent the Gillison classification of each sample. This classification categorizes the samples into three groups based on their clinical status:\n",
    "  - 1: Normal\n",
    "  - 2: Benign\n",
    "  - 3: Tumor\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**:  \n",
    "The purpose of this dataset is to provide a high-quality, integrated resource for researchers aiming to understand the molecular mechanisms of prostate cancer. It can be used for various applications, including identifying biomarkers, exploring gene expression patterns, and developing predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage**:  \n",
    "Researchers can utilize this dataset to:\n",
    "- Investigate gene expression differences across Normal, Benign, and Tumor samples.\n",
    "- Develop and validate predictive models for prostate cancer progression.\n",
    "- Explore potential biomarkers for early detection and treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Acknowledgments**:  \n",
    "Special thanks to the researchers who originally published the GSE datasets and to the NCBI GEO database for making these data publicly available. This dataset was compiled with great care to provide a valuable resource for the scientific community."

    "1. **Importing the Pandas Library**: The first line imports the `pandas` library, a powerful data manipulation and analysis tool in Python that provides data structures and functions for efficiently handling structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loading the CSV Data**:\n",
    "   - We use `pd.read_csv()` to load the dataset from a CSV file named `Prostate_Cancer_Genomics.csv`.\n",
    "   - The `header=1` parameter indicates that the actual column headers are located in the second row of the CSV file (index 1). This means the first row (index 0) will be skipped, which is useful if the first row contains metadata or notes rather than the header information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verifying Data Loading**:\n",
    "   - The line `df.head()` displays the first few rows of the loaded DataFrame, allowing us to verify that the data has been loaded correctly and the headers are properly set. This is essential for ensuring that subsequent data manipulation or analysis steps are performed on the intended dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this process is critical for preparing the data for analysis or modeling, ensuring that the structure is correct and the relevant information is accessible."

    "### **Analysis of Prostate Cancer Genomics Classification Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "This code snippet provides a detailed breakdown of the steps involved in loading, processing, and analyzing a prostate cancer genomics dataset. The model’s performance is evaluated using a placeholder random prediction, which highlights areas for improvement in classification capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **📦 Importing Libraries**\n",
    "   - `pandas`: For data manipulation.\n",
    "   - `numpy`: For numerical operations.\n",
    "   - `confusion_matrix` and `classification_report` from `sklearn.metrics`: To evaluate the model's predictive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **📄 Loading the Data**\n",
    "   - The dataset is loaded from the file `Prostate_Cancer_Genomics.csv`, with the header set to the second row (`header=1`) to correctly align the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **🔍 Extracting Gillison Classification**\n",
    "   - **Helper Function**: A function named `extract_gillison_class` extracts the clinical classification from each sample column’s name, identifying it as `1` (Normal), `2` (Benign), or `3` (Tumor).\n",
    "   - **Column Processing**: The list of column names is filtered to exclude the gene identifier column, ensuring only sample data is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **📋 Creating Metadata DataFrame**\n",
    "   - A new `metadata` DataFrame is created with:\n",
    "      - **Sample IDs (GSM IDs)**: Unique identifiers for each sample.\n",
    "      - **Gillison Classification**: The classification label (1, 2, or 3) derived from sample column names.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **🔄 Mapping Gillison Classes to Cancer/Non-Cancer**\n",
    "   - **Mapping Dictionary**: This dictionary translates the Gillison classes into more interpretable labels:\n",
    "      - `1`: Mapped to \"Non-Cancer\"\n",
    "      - `2` and `3`: Mapped to \"Cancer\"\n",
    "   - **Adding Cancer_Status Column**: The `Cancer_Status` column is added to the metadata, making it easier to separate Cancer vs. Non-Cancer samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **🔀 Reshaping the Original Data**\n",
    "   - The gene expression DataFrame is transposed so that:\n",
    "      - **Rows represent samples** and **columns represent gene expression levels**.\n",
    "   - **Index Reset**: GSM IDs are reset as a standard column, allowing straightforward merging with metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **🔗 Merging Metadata with Transposed Data**\n",
    "   - **Final DataFrame**: The `metadata` DataFrame is merged with the gene expression data to combine sample information (e.g., Cancer_Status) with gene expression values, creating a single dataset ready for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **📊 Generating a Confusion Matrix**\n",
    "   - **True Labels**: Extracted from the `Cancer_Status` column.\n",
    "   - **Predicted Labels**: Random predictions are used as placeholders.\n",
    "   - **Confusion Matrix**: Provides insight into how well the model differentiates between Cancer and Non-Cancer cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **📈 Evaluating Model Performance**\n",
    "   - The `classification_report` shows metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class (Cancer and Non-Cancer).\n",

    "\n",
    "The random prediction approach yields low performance metrics, with an overall accuracy of 48%. Both classes (Cancer and Non-Cancer) exhibit low precision, recall, and F1-scores, particularly for Cancer samples. This is likely due to the use of random labels as predictions rather than a trained model. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations**:\n",
    "- Implement a more sophisticated classification model, such as a CatBoost or SVM classifier, trained on actual data.\n",
    "- Optimize feature selection and class balancing (e.g., using SMOTE) to enhance model sensitivity and specificity.\n",
    "- Regularly validate the model with cross-validation to ensure stability and robustness across different samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps will significantly improve the ability to distinguish between Cancer and Non-Cancer cases, making the model more reliable and insightful for clinical applications."
